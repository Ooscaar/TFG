### Introduction
An Introduction that clearly states the rationale of the thesis that includes:
1. Statement of purpose (objectives).
2. Requirements and specifications.
3. Methods and procedures, citing if this work is a continuation of another project or
it uses applications, algorithms, software or hardware previously developed by other
authors.
4. Work plan with tasks, milestones and a Gantt diagram.
5. Description of the deviations from the initial plan and incidences that may have
occurred.

### State of the art
A background, comprehensive review of the literature is required. This is known as the
Review of Literature and should include relevant, recent research that has been done on
the subject matter.

## Repo structure
TODO: emulate "commai" repo

## Usage
To compile and generate the resulting pdf:
```
latexmk -pdf -shell-escape -output-directory=build thesis.tex
```

## Latex packages
- comment: insert comments in latex
```
Usage:
\begin{comment}
...
\end{comment}
```

- supertabular: kind of extended tabular package for creating "long" tables (extends tabular package)

- graphics: include images

- soul: in order to highligth text and etc (usage with \hl)

- booktabs: extra for tables?

- paralist: to create list (itemize and etc ...)

- algorithmicx/algorithm: in order to create algorithms (view template example)

- algpseudocode: create pseudocode blocks
Usage: 
```
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State first line
	\Statex continuing first line
	\State \Call{Proc}{a1, a2}
	\State \Output Hello World!\
end{algorithmic}
```

- hvfloat: defines a macro to place objects (tables and figures) and their captions in different positions
```
\hvFloat{float type}{floating object}{caption}{label}
```

- chngpage: change page layout in middle of the document

- afterpage: execute command after the end of the page
```
\afterpage{\clearpage}
```

- parskip: ?

- babel: ?

- amsmath/amsfonts/amssymb: I guess math support ...

- caption: support for caption on floating elements
```
\caption{}
```

- fontenc: font encoding

- multicol/multirow: ??

- array: extends array and tabular environments

- relsize: set the font size relative to the current font size

- subcaptions: same as captions but for subfigures

- tcolorbox: colored boxes

- lscape: place selected of a document in lanscape

- lastpage: reference the last page of the document

- acro: acronyms

- appendix: extra control of appendices

- tocbinding: for show reference in toc

- pgfgantt â€“ Draw Gantt charts with TikZ

And extra packages, for the moment:

- microtype: no idea, should look better

- minted: better source code
```
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=gray,breaklines]{python}
