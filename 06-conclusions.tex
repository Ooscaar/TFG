\section{Conclusions}
In this thesis we have achieved the following accomplishments:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Improvement of the ``lxce'' command line tool in a more improved, tested version.}
	\item{Added functionalities to the ``lxce-admin'' tool improving the management of the containers.}
	\item{Complete build of an initial web application with a view for improvements and extensibility.}
\end{itemize}

The main limitations were working and learning a new technology (``containerization'') not known at the beginning of the project, plus developing the set of tools in a programming language (javascript/typescript) without any previous experience. Also for development of the web application learning about React was needed.

Also, some systems administration research was needed for setting up the development environment.
